    <h2>What is Attar? Meaning, History & Uses</h2>
    <p>
      Attar is an oil-based, alcohol-free perfume traditionally produced using
      natural botanical ingredients. Known for its longevity and purity, attar
      has been used in India for centuries for personal wear, rituals and luxury perfumery.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Why Kannauj is Called the Perfume Capital of India</h2>
    <p>
      Kannauj has preserved ancient fragrance-making traditions such as the
      deg-bhapka distillation process. The city supplies natural attars and
      perfume oils across India and global markets.
    </p>
    <div class="article">

  <h2>Is attar better than perfume?</h2>
  <p>
    Attar is often considered better than perfume because it is alcohol-free,
    longer lasting and skin-friendly. Attars mature naturally on the skin,
    making them ideal for daily use, religious purposes and sensitive skin.
  </p>

  <h2>Which city is famous for attar in India?</h2>
  <p>
    Kannauj, located in Uttar Pradesh, is famous worldwide for attar manufacturing.
    Known as the perfume capital of India, Kannauj has preserved traditional
    fragrance distillation techniques for centuries.
  </p>

  <h2>Is attar used daily?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, attar can be used daily. Because it is oil-based and alcohol-free,
    attar is gentle on the skin and suitable for regular wear in all seasons.
  </p>

</div>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>How Traditional Attar is Made in Kannauj (Deg-Bhapka Process)</h2>
    <p>
      The deg-bhapka method uses copper vessels where natural ingredients are
      slowly distilled. Aromatic vapors bind with sandalwood oil, creating
      concentrated and long-lasting attars without alcohol.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Why Attars Last Longer Than Alcohol-Based Perfumes</h2>
    <p>
      Attars evaporate slowly due to their oil base, while alcohol perfumes
      evaporate quickly. This gives attars superior longevity and evolving
      fragrance profiles on the skin.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Why Retailers Prefer Buying Attars Directly from Kannauj</h2>
    <p>
      Retailers sourcing from Kannauj benefit from authenticity, stable quality,
      competitive wholesale pricing and deep fragrance knowledge passed down
      through generations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Attar Wholesale Price List – Complete Guide for Retailers</h2>

    <p>
      Retailers searching for an <strong>attar wholesale price list</strong> often want
      clear pricing, consistent quality and reliable supply. Kannauj, known as the
      perfume capital of India, remains the primary hub for bulk attar sourcing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wholesale attar prices depend on factors such as raw materials, fragrance
      concentration, oil base and order quantity. Natural floral attars usually
      cost more than synthetic blends due to longer distillation time and
      botanical sourcing.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Pristine Perfume, we provide <strong>bulk attar pricing</strong> suitable for
      retailers, resellers and perfume shop owners looking to maintain healthy
      margins without compromising fragrance performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retailers looking for <strong>Kannauj attar wholesale</strong> suppliers should
      focus on consistency, repeat availability and transparent pricing rather
      than only the lowest rate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>How Attar Is Made – Traditional Perfume Making Process Explained</h2>

    <p>
      Many people search for <strong>how attar is made</strong> to understand why
      attars last longer than regular perfumes. Traditional attar making uses
      a slow distillation process known as <em>deg-bhapka</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this method, natural ingredients such as flowers, herbs or woods are
      distilled with water inside copper vessels. The aromatic vapours pass
      through bamboo pipes and are absorbed into a natural oil base, usually
      sandalwood oil.
    </p>

    <p>
      This slow process allows the fragrance to mature naturally, resulting in
      concentrated, alcohol-free perfume oils that develop beautifully on the skin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike modern spray perfumes, attars do not evaporate quickly and are
      suitable for daily wear, religious use and sensitive skin.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>Why Kannauj Is Famous for Perfume & Attars</h2>

    <p>
      Kannauj is called the <strong>perfume capital of India</strong> due to its
      centuries-old fragrance tradition. The region has preserved natural
      perfume-making techniques that are rarely found elsewhere in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The climate, availability of flowers and generational expertise make
      Kannauj ideal for producing authentic attars and perfume oils. Many
      Indian and international fragrance brands source oils from this region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even today, Kannauj remains a global reference point for natural attars,
      floral distillations and heritage perfume craftsmanship.

    <h2>Best Attar for Resale – Which Fragrances Sell the Most?</h2>

    <p>
      Many new retailers search for the <strong>best attar for resale</strong>
      when starting a perfume business. The most profitable attars are those
      that offer strong projection, long-lasting performance and mass appeal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Floral attars like rose and jasmine, musky blends and modern oud-inspired
      fragrances consistently perform well in retail markets across India.
      These fragrances attract repeat customers and generate stable margins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retailers often prefer oil-based attars because they require smaller
      quantities per sale, increasing overall profit per bottle.
